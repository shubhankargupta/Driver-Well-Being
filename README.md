# Driver-Well-Being

MERN stack application to improve the well being of workers by collecting their Fitbit Sensing Data and sharing with another person (i.e. supporter) who can help them to persuade to set and achieve personalized goals.  

## Prerequisties for the Application

Install the following software/databases in your system

1. Download Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. Download MongoDB Community Edition (https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/)

## Install dependencies
 
Navigate to the project directory and run the following command on the terminal
 
### `npm install`
 
## How to run the application

Open two different terminals.
In the first terminal, we will run the server (running on port 4000).
In the second terminal, we will run the client (running on port 3000).

In the first terminal, navigate to the project directory.
Then navigate to the backend directory

### `cd backend`

To run the server, enter the command 

### `npm start`. 

The above command will run the mongoDB server on port 4000

Now in the second terminal, navigate to the project directory.
Then navigate to the src directory

### `cd src`

To run the client, enter the command 

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
